The "RoverCommands" is a function that tell us the coordinates and heading of the Rover :
(x,y) are the coordinates
(NOURTH, SOUTH, EAST, WEST) are the headings.
I used for loop to tell it some of command anything other than these command should be undefined.

Details:
icluded of first Symble is "F" means to move forward
Second Symble is "B" means to move Backward
Third Symble is "L" means to move Left
Fourth Symble is "R" means to move Right
it makes his result depends of the heading and the command i told him
I used these symble and headings in my for loop.
